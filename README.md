# Next.js MongoDB Example

This is a simple example project demonstrating how to use Next.js with MongoDB. It includes a backend API to save user data to a MongoDB database and a frontend React component to interact with the backend.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```
__The backend server will run at http://localhost:5000.__

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and repeat the same steps as the backend.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
__The development server for the frontend will run at http://localhost:3000.__
